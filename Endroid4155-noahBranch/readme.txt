GAME OVERVIEW:

Level 1:
In the first level, the player must kill all slimes and destroy all enemy spawners before they 
can move onto the next room. In level 1, the player has the option to unlock a room, if they find 
the key (located in the top right of the room). Lastly, the player must defeat King Slime, the 
boss for level 1, before moving onto the next level.

Level 2:
In the 2nd level, the player will be fighting Intellect Devourers (brain-puppies). As in the first 
level the player must destroy the enemies and their spawners before moving onto the next room.
In the 2nd level, there are two rooms that can only be accessed by slaying all the spawners (portal's that send
an endless wave of creatures towards you until destroyed). After this, the blue portal will allow you entrance
to the lord of this domain. 

After defeating the last boss, the player may exit the dungeon, and has won the game. 
If the player loses all their lives, then they have lost the game.
